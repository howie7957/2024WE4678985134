    <p>Alright, for this combination I will test your knowledge of the Rose Lake area.</p>

    <p>On the drive that you have done many times, near the end of the long trip there is a stretch that takes you by Perham on highway 10.  When you exit left off of highway 10, you are on a road named with three numbers.  The first two numbers in this three digit number is the first number on one of the locks.</p>

    <p>Including Nonnie and Papa’s cabin and Giuliani's cabin, take the number of cabins between and add 10, that is the second number to the same lock.</p>

    <p>Take the population of Vergas Minnesota in 2014 and divide it by 10, that is the third number of the same lock.</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
